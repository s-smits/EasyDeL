Inference and Serving Solutions
===============================

EasyDeL provides powerful, production-ready serving solutions:

- **eSurge Engine**: High-performance inference engine with advanced KV cache management and paged attention
- **vInference Engine**: Optimized for efficient inference of large language models
- **vInference API Server**: Provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints for easy integration
- **vWhisper Inference**: Specialized inference engine for audio transcription and translation
- **Multimodal Support**: Process text, images, and audio with unified APIs
- **Streaming Generation**: Optimized for low-latency response streaming
- **Quantization Options**: Multiple precision options for optimal performance/quality trade-offs


Installation on TPU Pods
-----------------------

For distributed installation on TPU pods, use the ``install_on_hosts`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m easydel.scripts.install_on_hosts --tpu-type v4-16 --source github

This will install EasyDel and all required dependencies across all hosts in the specified TPU pod.
Supported TPU types include v2, v3, v4, v5e, and v5p pod slices.

For other TPU types you may need to overwrite that or customize the script.

Options:
- ``--source``: Choose between PyPI package (``pypi``) or latest GitHub version (``github``)
- ``--tpu-type``: Specify your TPU pod slice type (default: v4-16)
- ``--num-tpu-hosts``: Override default host count if needed


Future Updates and Vision üöÄ
============================

EasyDeL is constantly evolving to meet the needs of the machine learning community. In upcoming updates, we plan to introduce:

- **Cutting-Edge Features**: EasyDeL is committed to long-term maintenance and continuous improvement. We provide frequent updates, often on a daily basis, introducing new features, optimizations, and bug fixes.
- **Ready-to-Use Blocks**: Pre-configured, optimized building blocks for quick model assembly and experimentation.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Improved tools and methods for effortlessly scaling LLMs to handle larger datasets and more complex tasks.
- **Advanced Customization Options**: More flexibility in model architecture and training pipeline customization.
