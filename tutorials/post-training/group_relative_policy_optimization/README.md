# Tutorial: Fine-Tuning with GRPO on TPUs using EasyDeL & Ray

This tutorial will guide you through fine-tuning a language model (Cohere Aya-8B) on a math problem-solving dataset (NuminaMath) using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. We'll leverage the EasyDeL library for efficient JAX-based training and Ray for distributed execution on TPUs.

**What is GRPO?**
GRPO is an algorithm similar to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods like PPO, but often simpler to implement and tune for generative tasks. It aims to steer the model towards generating responses that maximize a given reward signal, often by comparing multiple generated responses.

**Key Technologies Used:**

* **EasyDeL:** A JAX-based library designed for easy and efficient training/fine-tuning of large language models, especially on TPUs.
* **Ray:** An open-source framework for building distributed applications, perfect for managing TPU resources.
* **JAX:** A Python library for high-performance numerical computing, especially well-suited for accelerators like TPUs.
* **Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets:** For model loading (tokenizer) and dataset access.
* **`math_verify`:** A utility to check the correctness of mathematical solutions.

## Prerequisites

1. **Google loud TPU:** You need access to a Google Cloud TPU environment (e.g., a TPU VM). This script is configured for a `v4-64` TPU pod slice.
2. **Google Cloud Account & Project:** Properly configured for TPU usage.
3. **Basic Python & ML Knowledge:** Familiarity with Python, virtual environments, and basic machine learning concepts.

---

## Step 1: Setting up your TPU Environment

The provided script uses a setup script from EasyDeL to prepare the TPU environment.

1. **SSH into your TPU VM.**
2. **Run the setup script:**

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erfanzar/EasyDeL/refs/heads/main/tpu_setup.sh)
    ```

    This script will install necessary dependencies like JAX, EasyDeL, Ray, and other Python packages required for TPU operation. It might take a few minutes.

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
    The script requires certain environment variables, especially API keys. You should set these in your TPU VM's environment.
    * `HF_TOKEN_FOR_EASYDEL`: Your Hugging Face token (if accessing private models/datasets, or to avoid rate limits). Get one from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
    * `WANDB_API_KEY_FOR_EASYDEL`: Your Weights & Biases API key if you want to use WandB for logging. Get one from [wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize).

    You can set them in your shell session:

    ```bash
    export HF_TOKEN_FOR_EASYDEL="your_hf_token_here"
    export WANDB_API_KEY_FOR_EASYDEL="your_wandb_api_key_here"
    # To make them persistent, add them to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
    # echo 'export HF_TOKEN_FOR_EASYDEL="your_hf_token_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
    # echo 'export WANDB_API_KEY_FOR_EASYDEL="your_wandb_api_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
    # source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    The script will pick these up using `os.environ.get()`.

## Step 2: Understanding the Python Script

Let's break down the provided Python script. Save it as `launch.py` (or any name you prefer) on your TPU VM.

# --- Script Entry Point ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This calls the main function, which is decorated to run on Ray TPUs.
    # Ray will handle distributing this call to the configured TPU resources.
    # Correction: The `eformer.executor.ray.execute` decorator handles launching.
    # So, a direct call to `main()` is what's intended IF the script itself
    # is what `ray job submit` or similar would target.
    
    # Let's stick to the original `main()` as it seems to be the pattern for `eformer.executor`.
    main()
```

---

## Step 3: Running the Script

1. **Save the Code:** Ensure the Python script (`grpo_math_finetune.py`) is on your TPU VM.
2. **Execute the Script:**
    From your TPU VM's terminal:

    ```bash
    python grpo_math_finetune.py
    ```

    * Ray will initialize.
    * The `@execute(tpu_config)` decorator will provision the Ray actors on the TPUs according to `tpu_config`.
    * The `main()` function will then run on these Ray actors.
    * You'll see logs related to dataset loading, model sharding, and then the training progress (loss, rewards, etc.).
    * If WandB is enabled, metrics will be logged there.
    * Checkpoints will be saved according to `save_steps` and `save_directory` (if specified, defaults to `./EasyDeL-Checkpoints/`).

---

## Key Points and Customization

* **TPU Configuration (`tpu_config`):**
  * `accelerator`: Change `"v4-64"` to match your TPU setup (e.g., `"v3-8"`, `"v4-128"`, `"v6-128"`).
  * `execution_env`: If you have other environment variables or pip packages specific to your Ray workers, add them here.
* **Model and Dataset (`MODEL_ID`, `DATASET_ID`):**
  * You can easily swap these out for other Hugging Face models or datasets. Ensure your dataset mapping and tokenization functions are adjusted accordingly.
* **GRPO Configuration (`grpo_config`):**
  * `total_batch_size`: Adjust based on your TPU memory.
  * `learning_rate`, `num_train_epochs`: Standard hyperparameters to tune.
  * `beta`: This is a key GRPO parameter. It controls how much the policy can deviate from a reference (in this case, implicitly, its own previous state or a frozen copy). Higher beta means stronger regularization towards the reference.
  * `num_return_sequences`: GRPO generates multiple candidate responses and uses rewards to select/rank them. This is crucial for its operation.
* **Reward Functions:**
  * This is where GRPO's power lies. You can define custom Python functions to score the generated text based on any criteria: fluency, relevance, safety, specific formatting, factual accuracy, etc.
  * The script uses two: one for format (`<think>...</think>`) and one for math accuracy. The trainer will likely sum these rewards (or you can implement weighted summing).
* **Sharding (`sharding_axis_dims`):**
  * The `(1, -1, 1, 1, 1)` is a common setting for Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)-like behavior. For very large models or different TPU topologies, you might need to adjust this. Consult EasyDeL documentation for advanced sharding.
* **Memory (`/dev/shm`):**
  * Using `/dev/shm` for Hugging Face cache can significantly speed up dataset loading if datasets are repeatedly accessed, as it's a RAM disk.
* **Saving (`save_directory`):**
  * By default, models save to a local directory. For larger models or more permanent storage, consider setting `save_directory` in `GRPOConfig` to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket path (e.g., `"gs://your-bucket-name/grpo-checkpoints"`). Ensure your TPU VM has write access to the bucket.

This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the script and how to run it. GRPO is a powerful technique, and EasyDeL + Ray makes it accessible for large-scale training on TPUs. Happy fine-tuning!
