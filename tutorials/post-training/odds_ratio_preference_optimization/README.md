# Tutorial: Fine-Tuning with ORPO on TPUs using EasyDeL & Ray

This tutorial will guide you through fine-tuning a large language model, **Qwen3-14B**, on a preference dataset using the **Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO)** algorithm. We'll leverage the EasyDeL library for efficient JAX-based training and Ray for distributed execution on Google TPUs.

**What is ORPO?**
ORPO is a novel fine-tuning technique that combines standard instruction tuning (Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and preference alignment into a single, elegant training stage. Unlike DPO, which requires a model to first be instruction-tuned, ORPO uses a unique loss function that simultaneously maximizes the likelihood of the "chosen" (preferred) response while penalizing the "rejected" (dispreferred) response.

**Key Advantages of ORPO:**

* **Simplicity & Efficiency:** It merges SFT and preference tuning into one step, simplifying the fine-tuning pipeline and reducing computational requirements.
* **Improved Performance:** By learning from both the "chosen" response and the preference pair, ORPO can achieve strong results without the need for complex, multi-stage training.
* **Stability:** It avoids some potential pitfalls of traditional RLHF methods by using a direct loss function.

**Key Technologies Used:**

* **EasyDeL:** A JAX-based library designed for easy and efficient training/fine-tuning of large language models, especially on TPUs. It provides optimized trainers and model sharding.
* **Ray:** An open-source framework for building distributed applications, perfect for managing and coordinating compute resources like TPUs.
* **JAX:** A Python library for high-performance numerical computing, providing automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation, making it ideal for accelerators like TPUs.
* **Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets:** For seamless model (tokenizer/processor) loading and efficient dataset access from the Hugging Face Hub.

## Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud TPU:** You need access to a Google Cloud TPU environment (e.g., a TPU VM). This script is specifically configured for a `v4-64` TPU pod slice. Adjust the configuration if you have a different TPU type or size.
2. **Google Cloud Account & Project:** Properly configured for TPU usage, including necessary IAM permissions.
3. **Basic Python & ML Knowledge:** Familiarity with Python, virtual environments, and fundamental machine learning concepts.

---

## Step 1: Setting up your TPU Environment

The provided script relies on a setup script from EasyDeL to prepare the TPU environment with all necessary dependencies.

1. **SSH into your TPU VM.**
2. **Run the EasyDeL setup script:**

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erfanzar/EasyDeL/refs/heads/main/tpu_setup.sh)
    ```

    This command downloads and executes a script that installs required packages such as JAX, EasyDeL, Ray, Hugging Face libraries, and other Python dependencies optimized for TPU operation. This process might take several minutes.

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
    The Python script expects certain sensitive tokens (like Hugging Face and Weights & Biases API keys) to be available as environment variables. You should set these in your TPU VM's environment.

    * `HF_TOKEN_FOR_EASYDEL`: Your Hugging Face token. This is required to download models and datasets, especially if they are private or if you want to avoid rate limits. Generate one from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
    * `WANDB_API_KEY_FOR_EASYDEL`: Your Weights & Biases API key. This is needed if you plan to use WandB for experiment tracking and logging. Get one from [wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize).

    You can set them temporarily for your current shell session:

    ```bash
    export HF_TOKEN_FOR_EASYDEL="hf_YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN_HERE"
    export WANDB_API_KEY_FOR_EASYDEL="YOUR_WANDB_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    To make these environment variables persistent across reboots or new SSH sessions, add them to your shell's profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

    ```bash
    echo 'export HF_TOKEN_FOR_EASYDEL="hf_YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN_HERE"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export WANDB_API_KEY_FOR_EASYDEL="YOUR_WANDB_API_KEY_HERE"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc # Apply changes
    ```

    The Python script will then retrieve these values using `os.environ.get()`.

## Step 2: Understanding the Python Script

Save the provided Python script as `orpo_finetune.py` (or any other `.py` name) on your TPU VM. Let's walk through its key components.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # When the script is executed, `main()` is called. The decorators ensure

    main()
```

---

## Step 3: Running the Script

1. **Save the Code:** Ensure the Python script (`orpo_finetune.py`) is saved on your TPU VM.
2. **Execute the Script:**
    From your TPU VM's terminal:

    ```bash
    python orpo_finetune.py
    ```

    * Ray will initialize, and the `@execute(tpu_config)` decorator will provision the Ray actors on the TPUs.
    * The `main()` function will then run on these actors.
    * You'll see logs related to dataset loading, model sharding, and then the ORPO training progress (loss, log-probabilities, etc.).
    * If Weights & Biases (WandB) is enabled, metrics will be logged to your WandB dashboard.
    * Checkpoints will be saved according to `save_steps` and `save_directory`.

---

## Key Points and Customization

* **TPU Configuration (`tpu_config`):**
  * `accelerator`: Change `"v4-64"` to match your specific TPU setup (e.g., `"v3-8"`, `"v4-128"`, `"v5e-128"`). Ensure your Cloud TPU VM type matches this configuration.
* **Model and Dataset (`MODEL_ID`, `DATASET_ID`):**
  * You can easily swap `Qwen/Qwen3-14B` for other Hugging Face causal language models.
  * Similarly, replace `mlabonne/orpo-dpo-mix-40k` with any other dataset formatted with `chosen` and `rejected` columns.
* **ORPO Configuration (`ed.ORPOConfig`):**
  * `learning_rate`: ORPO can often tolerate slightly higher learning rates than DPO because it includes an SFT-like objective. `8e-6` is a good starting point.
  * `beta`: This is the **key ORPO hyperparameter**. It controls the trade-off between the SFT loss (fitting the "chosen" response) and the odds ratio preference loss. A higher beta gives more weight to the preference component. The default of `0.1` is a common starting point.
  * `do_eval` and `eval_dataset`: In the provided script, `do_eval` is `True` but `eval_dataset` is `None`. This means EasyDeL will perform evaluation, but it will do so on a subset of the *training dataset*. To get a more reliable measure of generalization, you should load a separate test/validation split and pass it to `eval_dataset`. For example:

    ```python
    # In main():
    dataset = load_dataset(DATASET_ID, split="train")
    eval_dataset = load_dataset(DATASET_ID, split="test")

    # In ORPOTrainer():
    trainer = ed.ORPOTrainer(
        #...
        train_dataset=dataset,
        eval_dataset=eval_dataset
    )
    ```

* **Sharding (`sharding_axis_dims`):**
  * The `(1, -1, 1, 1, 1)` setting is a robust default for FSDP-like sharding. For very large models or different TPU topologies, you might need to adjust this. Consult EasyDeL documentation for advanced sharding strategies.
* **Saving (`save_directory`):**
  * For permanent storage, especially with large models, set `save_directory` in `ORPOConfig` to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket path (e.g., `"gs://your-bucket-name/orpo-checkpoints"`). Ensure your TPU VM has write access to the bucket.

This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the ORPO script and how to run it on TPUs. ORPO is a very promising and efficient method for model alignment, and the combination of EasyDeL and Ray makes it accessible for large-scale training. Happy fine-tuning
